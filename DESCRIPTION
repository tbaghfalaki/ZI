Description: Run a Gibbs sampler for hurdle models. The package includes the longitudinal zero-inflated hurdle models. The longitudinal zero-inflated models include Poisson, generalized Poisson, and negative binomial distributions. The primary focus of this package is to estimate joint models for zero-inflated longitudinal measurements and time-to-event data under Poisson, generalized Poisson, and negative binomial distributions. The function "ZIJM" considers joint modeling with a proportional hazard sub-model and a piecewise constant baseline hazard by treating the current value as the association between the two sub-models. The function "ZISRE" involves joint modeling with a Weibull sub-model by incorporating a shared random effects model.
